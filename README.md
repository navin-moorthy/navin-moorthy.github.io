Thanks to [@bradlc](https://github.com/bradlc)‚Äôs work on [babel-plugin-tailwind-components](https://github.com/bradlc/babel-plugin-tailwind-components), we can easily get the power of Tailwind without the stylesheet bloat by passing Tailwind classes into styled-components with **Babel macros** üéâ.

**Please note:** The parallax effect can be quite heavy for some older CPUs and the site uses some newer CSS features which will result in incompatibility with older browsers.

## üöÄ Quick start

Check your development environment! You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), the [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) and [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation) installed. The official Gatsby website also lists two articles regarding this topic:

- [Gatsby on Windows](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-on-windows/)
- [Check your development environment](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/)

To copy and install this starter run this command (with "project-name" being the name of your folder you wish to install it in):

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the blog starter.

```sh
gatsby new project-name https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-portfolio-cara
cd project-name
npm run dev
```

Your site is now running at `http://0.0.0.0:8080`!

_Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://0.0.0.0:8080/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

Edit `src/pages/index.js`, save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

### Adding new features/plugins

You can add other features by having a look at the official [plugins page](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/plugins/).

### Building your site

```sh
npm run build
```

Copy the content of the `public` folder to your webhost or use a website like Netlify which automates that for you.

## üéì Configuration

You have multiple options to configure this project.

1. Use the `config/website.js` to configure data passed to the SEO component and other parts of the Gatsby site

2. Use the `tailwind.js` file to configure TailwindCSS. Their [documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration) explains it step-by-step.

3. Modify the files in the `src/styles` directory.

4. Modify the sections in the `src/views` directory. They contain the Dividers & SVG icons.

5. You can also place the icons somewhere else on the page, modify their animation and hide them on smaller screens:

```JSX
  <SVG icon="triangle" hideMobile width={48} stroke={colors.orange} left="10%" top="20%" />
  <SVG icon="hexa" width={48} stroke={colors.red} left="60%" top="70%" />
  <SVG icon="box" width={6} fill={colors['grey-darker']} left="60%" top="15%" />
```

- For `icon`, you have the options: `triangle, circle, arrowUp, upDown, box, hexa, cross`
- If you want the SVG to be hidden on mobile view, add `hideMobile` to the SVG component
- You can define the width via the TailwindCSS width [option](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/width)
- The colors get defined via the TailwindCSS color [option](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors)
  - Please note that you will either have to define the color in `stroke` **or** `fill` depending on the icon. For reference, have a look at the currently used SVGs
- The options `left` and `top` position the icon relatively to its parent container
- You can also wrap the SVGs with `<UpDown />` or `<UpDownWide />` to animate them

### Typography

Instead of relying on Google's CDN to host its fonts, this site self-hosts the fonts and therefore benefits from increased performance. The installed fonts can be found in `src/components/Layout.jsx`:

```JSX
import 'typeface-cantata-one';
import 'typeface-open-sans';
```

This starter uses [typefaces](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typefaces) by Kyle Mathews. Have a look at the repository if you want to install & use other fonts.

You'll also need to configure `fonts` in `tailwind.js` to reflect the changes. You then can use the fonts with `font-sans` and `font-serif`.
