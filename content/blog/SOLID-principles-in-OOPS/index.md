## Principles

### Single-responsibility Principle

> A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

### Open-closed Principle

> Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

### Liskov substitution principle

> Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.

### Interface segregation principle

> A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

### Dependency Inversion principle

> Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
