👨‍💻 By [Rajat S](https://blog.bitsrc.io/@geeky_writer_)

9 Useful Tips for writing better code in [React](https://reactjs.org/): Learn about Linting, propTypes, PureComponent and more.

- [EsLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [propTypes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) and defaultProps
- Know when to make new components
  - Is your code’s functionality becoming unwieldy?
  - Does it represent its own thing?
  - Are you going to reuse your code?
- Component vs PureComponent vs Stateless Functional Component
  - Stateless Functional Component - Does not using any kind of state, refs, or lifecycle methods.
  - Pure Components - Does not trigger a re-render if props do not change.
  - To check if re-render is unnecessary - [why did you update npm](http://github.com/maicki/why-did-you-update)
- Use [React Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
- Use Inline Conditional Statements
- Use [Snippet Libraries](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets) whenever possible
- [React Internals](http://www.mattgreer.org/articles/react-internals-part-one-basic-rendering/) — Learn how React works
- Use tools like Bit / StoryBook to improve your component development workflow
