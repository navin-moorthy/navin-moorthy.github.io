`How CSS animations were made?`

Animation property has a couple of sub-elements:

- **animation-name** ‚Äî specifies the keyframe name
- **animation-duration** ‚Äî specifies how long the animation should run
- **animation-timing-function** ‚Äî this configures the timing of the animation, which animation transitions through keyframes

Animation property can be declared like this:

```css
.mydiv {
  animation-duration: 3s;
  animation-name: my-animation;
  animation-iteration-count: 3;
  animation-direction: alternate;
}
```

Or shorthand version like this:

```css
/* @keyframes duration | timing-function | delay | name */
animation: 3s linear 1s my-animation;
```

**React** offers some built-in events for catching animation transitions in our components through the use of `SyntheticEvent` which is a **cross-browser wrapper around the browser‚Äôs native event**. Meaning, our React components can use native events because of this wrapper, including `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` native events.

`SyntheticEvent` has some support for animation, these are:

- **onAnimationStart** ‚Äî This event triggers the moment the animation started
- **onAnimationEnd** ‚Äî This event triggers the moment the animation ended
- **onAnimationIteration** ‚Äî This event triggers the moment the animation starts looping again
