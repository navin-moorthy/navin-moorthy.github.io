Hello readers, welcome to my first edition of Top 10 Links-Monthly Post 1. I have compiled a list of 10 cool things that I came across past month. I am very happy to give back to the community which helped me in learning a lot of information. This post was inspired from [“The 5 Hacking Newsletter”](https://pentester.land/newsletter) .
